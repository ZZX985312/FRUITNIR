# FRUITNIR
A GUI and its realted functions for NIRS modelling of fruit (Especial methods to correct for batch effects)

There are three ways to run this tool:
1. If you have matlab then you can either install the app in the matlab environment
2. You can download the fucntion and set the matlab to that folder and type T1 in the command window which will open the GUI
3. If you do not have matlab and still want to run the app, then it can be done by installing free matlab runtime environment

Their is no password to download the toolbox, but once downloaded and installed, starting GUI requires password and that password is 'welovenirs' (without comma and all in lower case)

In case of any doubt, problem in installation or suggestion to improve, just leave me an email at (puneet.mishra@wur.nl) or a message in LinkdeIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-puneet-mishra-73569142/)

Soon, I will prepare videos on how to use it and will provide a link to them here..........

I will also keep on adding new algorithms and approaches so that we can model NIRS easily and free of cost... ;)
