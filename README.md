# FRUITNIR
A GUI and its realted functions for NIRS modelling of fruit (Special methods to correct for batch effects). The original article can be found here https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521420309868

There are three ways to run this tool:
1. On a windows computer you can either install the app in the matlab environment or run it with MATLAB's runtime environment (download this for app 'FRUITNIR.zip')
2. You can download the fucntion (for both Mac or windows) and set the MATLAB's to that folder and type T1 in the command window which will open the GUI (download this for functions 'Fruitnirs_functions.zip')


The data set used in the original article was related to the study https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925521419311901.

To download you need to click on the .zip files. Check the .pptx file which explains the downloading process.

Their is no password to download the toolbox, but once downloaded and installed, starting GUI requires password and that password is 'welovenirs' (without comma and all in lower case)

In case of any doubt, problem in installation or suggestion to improve, just leave me an email at (puneet.mishra@wur.nl) or a message in LinkdeIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-puneet-mishra-73569142/)

Soon, I will prepare videos on how to use it and will provide a link to them here..........

I will also keep on adding new algorithms and approaches so that we can model NIRS easily and free of cost... ;)

ENJOY!
